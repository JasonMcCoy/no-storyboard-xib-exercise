# no-storyboard-xib-exercise
This is a simple exercise to practice building an app without storyboard.

Here is what I'm doing:

* Must have 3 view controllers
* Must not use storyboards (launch screen storyboard is fine)
* App Delegate must load first view controller
* First view controller must programmatically load the 2nd view controller (Using IBAction)
* The second view controller must programmatically load the 3rd view controller (Using IBAction)


Here is a .gif regarding what the app looks like:

Here is what my final xcode setup looks like:
